# ZFS BuddyBackup

A plugin for Unraid that aims to simplify backing up to a buddy that is also running Unraid and using ZFS.

This plugin sets up authentication and syncs raw encrypted ZFS snapshots. Your backup buddy will not have access to read any of your backed-up data, and can not access your server for anything other than sending and receiving their backups.

This plugin is fully open source, and I encourage you to review the source to ensure you understand how it operates and verify its security.
